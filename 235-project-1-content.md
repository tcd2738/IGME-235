Where’s Clippy?

I. High Concept <br>
A Where’s Waldo-esque game, where old-school computer mascot, Clippy, is hidden around various old web 
browsers and other outdated internet places.

II. Genre <br>
It would be a puzzle game that’s also “technically” a point-and-click, as that’s really all there it is
to it.

III. Platform <br>
It would be playable on both mobile and browsers. In browser, the whole image would be shown, and in 
mobile, it would be zoomed in, and you would have to swipe around. Which one is easier would really 
depend on the player.

IV. Story <br>
This would not be a very story-heavy game, but the basic premise could be you’ve time traveled back to 
the past to see your friend Clippy. Clippy, not wanting you to leave, as he has no other friends left, as
stolen pieces from your time machine. You must track him down through a 90s era browser to retrieve them.

V. Aesthetics <br>
It would be screenshot-realistic, as it would borrow from real-life images of older operating systems. It 
wouldn’t be sound effect heavy, but it would most likely have simple bleeps and bloops for finding things 
and an 8-bit backing track. There would also be ticks from the timer, and a beeping as the player gets 
closer to running out of time.

VI. Gameplay <br> <br>
  a. Mechanics <br>
    This would be a game of searching; most of the mechanics aren’t done within the browser. Clippy would 
    be randomly generated throughout images to give some form of replayability. There would also be a 
    countdown to find him. You will have to solve a certain number of screens within a time period in order
    to win.
    
  b. Controls <br>
    This game would be played fully using a mouse and clicking. There would be a menu the player can 
    interact with to go back or restart.

  c. Teaching the Game <br>
    There would be a quick tutorial just saying something along the lines of “click Clippy when you 
    find him”, and he would be highlighted in a mock-scene. The player shouldn’t have to be taught much,
    as this is a pretty universal concept.
    
  d. Player Learning <br>
    The game will mostly require learning strategy. The player will have to learn where to look and what
    to look for based off previous levels.

Documentation:

I. Process <br>
Started by creating content for game document and putting it on Git. Then I created a simple navigation bar and 
page layout. I added in all my content and tinkered with it to make it look nice. Finally, I added flourishes
accessibility bits.

II. Tools Used <br>
I used Gimp to make my image mockups. I also used the textbook to refresh myself on borders. For the few
flexbox elements on my page, I used <a href = https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox>this</a> 
handy website as a guide.

III. Successes <br>
I really liked how my design turned out. The colors are very appealing, and it looks sleek. I also think my content
and idea is very cool while still being a manageable scope.

IV. Future Improvements <br>
I could probably work on implementing accessibility features early on instead of later. I could probably also work on
how responsive my sites are.
